                     Tramp CVS usage instructions

The Tramp version number is in the `tramp-version' variable in
tramp.el and in the $(VERSION) variable in Makefile.  You should
update this version number whenever you make a release.  The version
number looks like X.Y.Z where X is the major revision, Y is the minor
revision, and Z is a patch level.

Together with each version 2.3.4 there should be a CVS tag V-2-3-4 so
that each released version can be identified.

Maybe someday the version number should be auto-generated from the
CVS tag name so that you don't have to maintain the version number
three times.

Tramp exists in three incarnations.  The CVS tree on Savannah is the
main version, but there is also a copy in XEmacs and a copy in the
Emacs CVS.

TODO: explain how to get the main version into XEmacs and into Emacs.
