                     Tramp CVS usage instructions

The Tramp version number is in the `AC_INIT' macro in `configure.ac',
everywhere else it is generated from.  You should update this version
number whenever you make a release.  After that, you need to call
`make configure' (or `autoconf --trace=AC_INIT' if you've cleaned up
the Makefile).  The version number looks like X.Y.Z where X is the
major revision, Y is the minor revision, and Z is a patch level.

Together with each version 2.3.4 there should be a CVS tag V-2-3-4 so
that each released version can be identified.

Maybe someday the version number should be auto-generated from the
CVS tag name so that you don't have to maintain the version number
three times.

Tramp exists in three incarnations.  The CVS tree on Savannah is the
main version, but there is also a copy in XEmacs and a copy in the
Emacs CVS.

TODO: explain how to get the main version into XEmacs and into Emacs.
