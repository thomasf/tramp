;; See the main module, 'rcp.el' for discussion of the purpose of RCP.
;; This module provides integration between remote files accessed by RCP and
;; the Emacs version control system.

;; -- vc --

;; This used to blow away the file-name-handler-alist and reinstall
;; RCP into it. This was intended to let VC work remotely. It didn't,
;; at least not in my XEmacs 21.2 install.
;; 
;; In any case, rcp-run-real-handler now deals correctly with disabling
;; the things that should be, making this a no-op.
;;
;; I have removed it from the rcp-file-name-handler-alist because the
;; shortened version does nothing. This is for reference only now.
