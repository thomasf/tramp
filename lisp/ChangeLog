	variable.
	(tramp-post-connection): Use it.
	(tramp-get-file-exists-command): Access variable.
	(tramp-bug): Report a few more variable settings.

2000-09-16  Kai Groﬂjohann  <Kai.Grossjohann@CS.Uni-Dortmund.DE>

	* tramp.el (tramp-open-connection-setup-interactive-shell): Set
	TERM=dumb as suggested by V. Balaji <vb@gfdl.gov>.

2000-09-14  Kai Groﬂjohann  <Kai.Grossjohann@CS.Uni-Dortmund.DE>

	* tramp.el (tramp-methods): Method `scpx' was missing a setting
	for `tramp-remote-sh'.

	* tramp.el (tramp-handle-insert-directory): Try to improve the
	logic as to what exactly is displayed.  The `/.' idea was snarfed
	from the standard `insert-directory'.

2000-09-01  Kai Groﬂjohann  <Kai.Grossjohann@CS.Uni-Dortmund.DE>

	* tramp.el (tramp-file-name-structure): Move `-' to beginning of
	[...].  Is this really necessary?  Well, it won't hurt.

	* tramp.el (tramp-file-name-structure): Allow `-' in user names.

2000-08-29  Kai Groﬂjohann  <Kai.Grossjohann@CS.Uni-Dortmund.DE>

	* Makefile (tramp.elc): Wrap long line.
	(tramp-vc.elc): Frob load-path for byte-compilation because of
	required libraries.

	* tramp-vc.el: Move `provide' to end of file.
	Require some needed libraries to avoid byte-compiler errors.

	* tramp.el (tramp-handle-file-name-all-completions): Expand
	DIRECTORY so that this also works with abbreviated file names.
	(tramp-handle-file-newer-than-file-p): Bug with `signal'.
	(tramp-handle-make-symbolic-link): Check that method, user, and
	host are the same when making symlinks.
	(tramp-bug): Report on more variables, change intro msg.

2000-08-25  Yuji Yamano <yyamano@kt.rim.or.jp>

	* tramp.el (tramp-perl-file-attributes): Use 0170000 as the right 
	value of Bitwise And instead of 0120000 and 040000. It works fine
	with block devices and sockets now.

2000-08-25  Yuji Yamano <yyamano@kt.rim.or.jp>

	* tramp.el (tramp-remote-path): Add "/usr/pkg/bin" to 
	tramp-remote-path for NetBSD packages.

2000-08-19  Kai Groﬂjohann  <Kai.Grossjohann@CS.Uni-Dortmund.DE>

	* tramp.el (tramp-multi-connect-su): Defer (erase-buffer) until
	after the buffer contents are used.

2000-08-18  Paul D. Smith  <pausmith@nortelnetworks.com>

	* tramp.el (tramp-pre-connection): Locally (to the connection
	buffer) set inhibit-eol-conversion to nil.

	`no-conversion' coding system on the local copy.

2000-08-18  Kai Groﬂjohann  <Kai.Grossjohann@CS.Uni-Dortmund.DE>

	* tramp.el (tramp-handle-file-exists-p): Use `test -e', not `ls
	-d'.
	(tramp-open-connection-setup-interactive-shell),
	(tramp-open-connection-telnet),
	(tramp-open-connection-rsh),
	(tramp-open-connection-su),
	(tramp-open-connection-multi),
	(tramp-multi-connect-telnet),
	(tramp-multi-connect-telnet),
	(tramp-multi-connect-rlogin),
	(tramp-multi-connect-su): Erase buffer before sending next
	command.
	(tramp-handle-make-directory): Correct order of arguments for
	tramp-barf-unless-okay.  Maybe I should be using keyword arguments
	in this case...
	(tramp-handle-insert-directory): Make it work with wildcards, too.
