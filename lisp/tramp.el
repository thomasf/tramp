;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides remote file editing, similar to ange-ftp.
;; The difference is that ange-ftp uses FTP to transfer files between
;; the local and the remote host, whereas rssh.el uses a combination
;; of ssh and scp.
;;
;; Installation is simple -- it is sufficient to load this file.
;;
;; Usage is also simple: it's just like ange-ftp, but uses a different
;; syntax for the remote file names.  The syntax used is as follows:
;;
;; /s:USER@HOST:FILENAME
;;
;; This logs you in as USER to the remote HOST, retrieving FILENAME.
;;
;; WARNING!
;;
;; This file is in a very early stage of development, there are a
;; number of limitations and of course a lot of unknown bugs.
;;
;; Firstly, you MUST have set up ssh such that you can log in as USER
;; to the remote HOST without entering a password or pass phrase.  The
;; code does *not* check if you have done this, so expect strange
;; effects when ssh asks you for a password or pass phrase.  (It is
;; fairly easy to allow login without entering a password or pass
;; phrase by using ssh-agent, or by using the .shosts file, or even
;; the .rhosts file.  Thus, I did not deem it important to deal with
;; querying for passwords in this early stage of development.)
;;
;; Secondly, there is almost no error checking at all.
;;
;; I have thus far tested this on one machine, as one user, with two
;; files and one directory.
;;
;; Here's what seems to work so far:
;;   - typing C-x C-f then entering a complete absolute file name
;;   - filename completion (for absolute file names)
;;   - saving files
;;   - getting a directory listing with dired (But why does `f' not work?)


;;; TODO:

;; * Use more variables for program names.
;; * Remote programs in regex alist to match host names?
;; * Use get-buffer-process rather than a buffer-local variable for
;;   the process.
