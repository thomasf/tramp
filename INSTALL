System Requirements
===================

Tramp has been used successfully on GNU Emacs 20 and GNU Emacs 21, as
well as XEmacs 21.  For XEmacs 21, you need the package `fsf-compat'
for the `with-timeout' macro.

For installation, it requires at least the following program versions:

  - GNU Autoconf 2.50 if sources are taken from CVS
  - GNU make 3.76
  - GNU texinfo 4.2

Tramp will be part of GNU Emacs starting with 21.4.


Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to build and install Tramp is:

  1. `cd' to the Tramp source directory.  If you've taken Tramp from
     the CVS sources, type `autoconf' in order to get an up-to-date
     `configure' script.

  2. Type `./configure --with-contrib' to configure Tramp for your system.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  3. Type `make' to build the byte-compiled Lisp files as well as the
     Info manual.

  4. Type `make install' to install the Tramp Lisp files and Info
     manual.

  5. You can remove the byte-compiled Lisp files and the Info manual
     from the source directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove
     the files that `configure' created, type `make distclean'.


Installation Names
==================

There are some Lisp packages which are not contained in older
(X)Emacsen by default yet.  In order to make a link for them into
Tramp's contrib directory, you must use the `--with-contrib' option:

	./configure --with-contrib

By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/info' and `/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp'.  You can
specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
`configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'.

If your installed copy of Emacs is named something other than `emacs'
or `xemacs', you will need to tell `make' where to find it so that it
can correctly byte-compile the Tramp sources.

For example, to force the use of XEmacs you might do this:

	./configure --with-xemacs
	make
	make install

The syntax of Tramp file names is different for GNU Emacs and XEmacs.
The Info manual will be generated for the Emacs flavor choosen in the
`configure' phase. If you want the other version, you need to set the
option `EMACS_INFO' to `make':

	./configure --with-emacs
	make EMACS_INFO=xemacs

Also, the `--prefix=PATH' option to `configure' may not be general
enough to set the paths you want.  If not, you can pass variables to
the `make' command to control the installation.  For a complete list
of tweakable variables, look in the makefile.

For example, to put the Lisp files in `$HOME/elisp' and the Info file
in `$HOME/info', you would type:

	./configure
	make
	make lispdir=$HOME/elisp infodir=$HOME/info install


Load Path
=========

If you don't install Tramp into the intended directories, but prefer
to use from the source directory, you need to add the following lines
into your .emacs (given "~/emacs/tramp" is your source directory):

        (add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs/tramp/lisp/")
        (add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list "~/emacs/tramp/info/")
        (require 'tramp)


Japanese Manual
===============

Thanks to Yoichi Nakayama <yoichi@geiin.org>, there exists a japanese
translation of the Tramp manual.  You can generate it applying the
`--with-japanese-manual' option:

	./configure --with-japanese-manual

This will result in an Info manual `tramp_ja'.
